EGSEA 1.1.1 (2016-05-10)
------------------------
- Improved: topSets(...) and the functionality of the "report" argument in the egsea(...) function.
- Improved: verbosity and "print.base" usability in egsea(). The statistics of individual methods can
now be exported in the output of egsea when print.base = TRUE. 
- Added: the fry(...) gene set test from the limma package.
- Added: multiple methods to combine the p-values of multiple methods. See egsea.combine().
- Fixed: various minor bugs. 

EGSEA 1.1.4 (2016-05-23)
------------------------
- Improved: ORA to adapt a cut-off threshold logFC=0 if no DE genes were 
found at logFC=1. In both cases, the cut-off threshold of adjusted p-value = 0.05.
- Improved: the robustness of the package and allows for single GSE analysis to be
carried out using EGSEA. 
- Added: Ensemble mode is disabled if one base GSE method is provided.
- Added: S4 class for the egsea() output, named EGSEAResults.
- Added: generic methods: show(), summary(), plotHeatmap(), plotPathway(), plotMDS(), 
and plotSummary(). 


EGSEA 1.1.5 (2016-05-27)
------------------------
- Fixed: a minor bug in EGSEAResults when symbolsMap = NULL
- Added: NA Gene Symbols are replaced with Feature IDs in the symbolsMap
- Added: FRY to egsea.base()
- Added: several sanity checks on the input parameters

EGSEA 1.1.6 (2016-05-31)
------------------------
- Fixed: a minor bug in the calculation of the comparative analysis p-value.
