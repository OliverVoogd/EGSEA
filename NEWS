EGSEA 1.1.1 (2016-05-10)
------------------------
- Improved topSets(...) and the functionality of the "report" argument in the egsea(...) function.
- Improved verbosity and "print.base" usability in egsea(). The statistics of individual methods can
now be exported in the output of egsea when print.base = TRUE. 
- Added the fry(...) gene set test from the limma package.
- Added multiple methods to combine the p-values of multiple methods. See egsea.combine().
- Various minor bug fixes. 

EGSEA 1.1.4 (2016-05-23)
------------------------
- ORA was modified to adapt a cut-off threshold logFC=0 if no DE genes were 
found at logFC=1. In both cases, the cut-off threshold of adjusted p-value = 0.05.
- Improve the robustness of the package and allows for single GSE analysis to be
carried out using EGSEA. 
- Ensemble mode is disabled if one base GSE method is provided.
- Created S4 class for the egsea() output, named EGSEAResults.
- Added generic methods: show(), summary(), plotHeatmap(), plotPathway(), plotMDS(), 
and plotSummary().
